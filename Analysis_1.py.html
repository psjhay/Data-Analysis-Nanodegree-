# ### Analysis 1: How does being on a scholarship affect a patients showing up?

# ##### Graphically

# In[12]:


sns.countplot(x='scholarship', hue='show', data= df_show)


# ##### Statistically 

# In[13]:


df_show.scholarship.value_counts()


# ###### The number of persons not on a scholarship is way smaller than that of those on a scholarship

# In[14]:


df_show.groupby('scholarship')['show'].value_counts()


# >*ratio of people on scholarship that showed up* **8283/10861**

# In[15]:


8283/10861


# >*ratio of people not on scholarship that showed up* **79924/99665**

# In[16]:


79924/99665


# ###### From the above
# > It can be seen that the percentage of people not on a scholarship and still showed up for their appointment is slightly higher than their counterparts

# #### Brief conclusion
# 
# ######  From tte graphical as well as the statistical analysis, we see that 
# 
# > About 20,000 persons not on a scholarship didn't show up
# 
# > for those on a scholarship, the number of persons not showing up is about 2,500
# 
# > Also, we see that scholarship may not be a correct determinant of a patient showing up as there exist a close relationship between the percentages of those that show up and those who didn't show up based on their scholarship positions.
