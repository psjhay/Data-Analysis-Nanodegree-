**How do different variables affect
a patients showing up or absence from an
appointment?** 

The dataset has 14 variables
distributed across *type of disease, 
neighborhood of patient, age, gender, 
alcohol addict, sms received and the 
variable which provides the information 
on whether a patient shows up or not*.
