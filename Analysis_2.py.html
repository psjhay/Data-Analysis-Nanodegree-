# > The plot above shows that only a small fraction of the patients in this survey are alcoholics.
# To give a correct insight into the data, let's find out the **percentage of non-alcoholic patients who keep their appointment** as well as the **percentage of alcoholic patients who keep their appointment**.

# In[13]:


df_show.groupby('alcoholism')['show'].value_counts()


# > *ratio of non alcoholics that show up is* **85524/107166**

# In[14]:


85524/107166


# >*ratio of alcoholics that show up is* **2683/3360**

# In[15]:


2683/3360


# ###### From the above we find that:
# 
# > about **79%** of persons are likely to keep their appointment irrespective of  their being alcoholics or non-alcoholics. Thus, alcoholism has a negligible impact on a patient's keeping an appointment.
