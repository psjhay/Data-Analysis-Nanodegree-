# ###### From the graph above, it is seen that:
# 
# > The middle half of non alcoholics is spread between ages 20 and 60 with the median just before 40; While alcoholics have an IQR between 40 and 60, and a median age just before 60.
# 
# > Furthermore, it can be seen that after the age of 80, the probability of being an alcoholic decreases drastically.
# 
# > Safe for outliers, it can be determined from the visual above that between the ages 0-18 years, one is less likely to be an alcohol addict.
